# Traffic control using Deep Learning and Computer Vision

The code was originally created for a hackathon. On entering video feed from a live 4 way junction, the algorithm detects the number of vehicles. Using this, the green light signal time for various roads are calculated. The detection is done using YOLOv3. After which, an algorithm computes the signal time.
